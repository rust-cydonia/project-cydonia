# Unit System

owo

## Summary

A large collection of ADTs corresponding to common units, like `Millimeters` for
mm, `Kilometers` for km, etc., which can all be converted between each other
implicitly through generics. This will make our data strongly typed and explicit
in the type system what unit a function expects.

## Summary

| Goal                                        | Status                   | Priority                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Unit System](goals/unit-system.md)         | **WIP**: Needs design    | **High**: Strong typing is a priority.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Query/Cache System](goals/query-system.md) | **WIP**: Not started yet | **Medium**: Unnecessary for v0.1.0, but as the project grows we will find that there are many functions that are called relatively frequently, cost a lot, yet are computed every single time theyâ€™re called; these are the perfect functions to be cached and are the main benefit of doing this. |
